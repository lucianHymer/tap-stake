### [18:49] [architecture] LibHalo NFC wallet integration pattern
**Details**: LibHalo enables NFC card wallets through a callback-based architecture:
1. Web/mobile/desktop support via execHaloCmdWeb/RN/PCSC APIs
2. Signing flow: NFC card holds ECDSA private key, signs digests via 'sign' command
3. Viem integration: createViemHaloAccount wraps NFC signing in standard Viem account interface
4. Wallet creation: getData() retrieves EOA address from card, signDigestCallback delegates signing to NFC
5. Transaction flow: serialize tx → generate digest → NFC sign → verify signer matches EOA
6. Supports both direct transactions and paymaster patterns (relayPermitAndTransfer for sponsored txs)
**Files**: viem_account.ts, index.ts, Burner.tsx

### [19:01] [architecture] EOA paymaster support on Optimism 2024-2025
**Details**: Multiple approaches for EOA gas sponsorship without smart wallets:
1. Circle Paymaster: Now supports EOAs directly on 7 chains including Optimism, using USDC for gas
2. EIP-7702 (2025): Allows EOAs to temporarily act as smart accounts for sponsored transactions
3. Alchemy has paymaster on Optimism (0x4Fd9098af9ddcB41DA48A1d78F91F1398965addc) but traditionally for smart wallets
4. BEP-414 standard: EOA-specific paymaster APIs (BSC-focused but shows the pattern)

Key insight: EOA paymaster support is emerging but fragmented - Circle's solution and EIP-7702 are the main paths forward for true EOA sponsorship without smart wallet deployment.

### [19:03] [architecture] EIP-7702 deployment status
**Details**: EIP-7702 is NOT yet live on Ethereum mainnet - scheduled for May 7, 2025 with Pectra upgrade. However, it IS already live on:
- BSC Mainnet
- Odyssey Testnet  
- Some OP-Stack chains (Base, Optimism, Zora)
- Ethereum testnets (Sepolia, Holesky)

This means we could potentially use EIP-7702 for EOA gas sponsorship on Optimism NOW, not waiting for Ethereum mainnet deployment.

### [19:05] [architecture] EIP-7702 NFC integration requirements
**Details**: To use EIP-7702 with NFC cards via libhalo, need to extend the viem account:
1. Current libburner viem_account only has signMessage/signTransaction/signTypedData
2. Need to add signAuthorization method that:
   - Encodes authorization message (chainId, nonce, contractAddress)
   - Hashes with keccak256
   - Signs digest via NFC signDigestCallback
   - Returns authorization with signature parts (y_parity, r, s)
3. Two-signature flow: First sign authorization, then sign transaction with authorizationList
4. This enables EOA to temporarily delegate to smart account for paymaster sponsorship
