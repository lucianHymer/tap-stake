### [13:13] [frontend] Tap-Stake demon-slayer theme implementation
**Details**: Created a fun, tongue-in-cheek demon-slayer themed frontend for the Tap-Stake NFC wallet app. Features:
- Bold "TAP STAKE" title in Bebas Neue font with glowing red blood effect
- Moloch statue images (moloch1.png and moloch2.png) as centerpiece - clicking switches between them to show stake being hammered
- Dark demonic aesthetic with black/red color scheme and blood-like gradients
- All content vertically and horizontally centered in viewport
- Interactive flow: first tap reads NFC card, second tap signs message "I SLAY MOLOCH, DEMON OF DIS-COORDINATION!"
- Technical info styled as arcane knowledge (addresses as "SLAYER'S SIGIL", signatures as "BLOOD SEAL")
- Animated effects: pulsing text, scanning lines on tech cards, stake impact animation
- Victory message "MOLOCH IS SLAIN! COORDINATION RESTORED!" when signature verified
- Collapsible "ARCANE REQUIREMENTS" section for technical requirements
