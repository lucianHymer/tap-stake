# Biome Migration Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of issue #13 - migrating from ESLint to Biome for unified linting and formatting with automated CI/CD workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Biome Configuration (`biome.json`)
Created a new Biome configuration file at the root level with:
- Formatting rules: 2-space indentation, 100 character line width, single quotes, semicolons
- Linting rules: recommended rules enabled, strict `noExplicitAny` error
- File ignores: node_modules, dist, build, .wrangler, and contracts package
- VCS integration enabled for git

### 2. Root Package.json Updates
Added scripts:
- `check`: Run Biome check on entire codebase
- `check:write`: Run Biome check with auto-fix
- `format`: Run format scripts in all workspaces
- `lint`: Run lint scripts in all workspaces

Added dependency:
- `@biomejs/biome`: ^1.9.4

### 3. Frontend Package Migration
**package.json changes:**
- Replaced `lint: eslint .` with Biome scripts:
  - `format`: Format source files
  - `lint`: Lint source files
  - `check`: Combined format and lint check
  - `check:write`: Combined format and lint with auto-fix
- Removed ESLint dependencies:
  - `@eslint/js`
  - `eslint`
  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
  - `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`
  - `globals`
  - `typescript-eslint`

**Deleted files:**
- `packages/frontend/eslint.config.js`

### 4. Relayer Package Migration
**package.json changes:**
- Replaced ESLint scripts with Biome scripts (same as frontend)
- Removed ESLint dependencies:
  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
  - `@typescript-eslint/parser`
  - `eslint`

**Deleted files:**
- `packages/relayer/eslint.config.js`

### 5. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`)
Created a new workflow that:
- **Triggers:** Only on push to main branch (after PR merge)
- **Steps:**
  1. Checkout code
  2. Setup Node.js with npm cache
  3. Install dependencies
  4. Run Biome check
  5. Run tests (if available, gracefully handles missing tests)
  6. Auto-fix issues if Biome check fails
  7. Create PR with fixes if changes were made
  8. Create GitHub issue if auto-fix cannot resolve problems

**Features:**
- Auto-fix PR includes descriptive body with workflow run link
- Issues include failure details and links to workflow logs
- No `///review` keyword in issues (per user preference)
- Labels: `automated`, `code-quality`

## Post-Merge Instructions

After this PR is merged, run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Install Biome and clean up old ESLint dependencies
npm install

# 2. Apply initial Biome formatting to all files
npm run check:write

# 3. Review the changes
git diff

# 4. Commit the formatting changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: apply initial Biome formatting"

# 5. Push to main
git push
```

## Usage

### Running Checks Locally

```bash
# Check entire codebase
npm run check

# Auto-fix entire codebase
npm run check:write

# Check specific package
cd packages/frontend
npm run check

# Auto-fix specific package
cd packages/frontend
npm run check:write
```

### How the Workflow Works

1. **When code is pushed to main:**
   - Workflow automatically runs Biome checks

2. **If formatting/linting issues are found:**
   - Workflow attempts auto-fix with `npm run check:write`
   - If successful, creates a PR with the fixes
   - PR title: "ðŸ¤– Auto-fix: Code Quality"

3. **If auto-fix cannot resolve issues:**
   - Creates a GitHub issue with details
   - Issue title: "ðŸš¨ Code Quality Issues Detected (Auto-fix failed)"
   - Includes links to workflow logs for debugging

## Migration Notes

### What Changed
- **Before:** ESLint for linting only, no automated formatting
- **After:** Biome for both linting AND formatting in a single tool

### Benefits
- 10-30x faster than ESLint + Prettier
- Unified tool for formatting and linting
- Single configuration file
- Better TypeScript support
- Automated enforcement via CI/CD

### Compatibility
Biome is 97% compatible with ESLint/Prettier but some rules may differ slightly. The initial `npm run check:write` will standardize all code to Biome's rules.

## Testing

Before merging, you can test locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies (requires npm install approval)
npm install

# Test check command
npm run check

# Test auto-fix
npm run check:write

# Verify no changes if already formatted
git diff
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Permission Issues
If the workflow fails with permission errors, check:
- Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions
- Should be set to "Read and write permissions"
- Enable "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"

### Biome Check Failures
If `npm run check` fails after formatting:
- Review the errors shown
- Some issues may require manual fixes
- Check that React hooks dependencies are properly validated

## Files Modified

```
.github/workflows/code-quality.yml (NEW)
biome.json (NEW)
package.json (MODIFIED)

## Branch Information

- **Branch name:** `feature/biome-linting-workflow`
- **Workspace path:** `/workspace/lucianHymer-tap-stake-a92d143cc8269361`
- **Commit:** Configuration and workflow setup completed

## Next Actions Required

Since the GitHub App doesn't have `workflows` permission, you'll need to manually push the branch:

```bash
cd /workspace/lucianHymer-tap-stake-a92d143cc8269361
git push -u origin feature/biome-linting-workflow
```

Then create the PR:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat: migrate to Biome for unified linting and formatting" \
  --body "Fixes #13

## Summary
This PR migrates from ESLint to Biome for unified linting and formatting, and adds a GitHub Actions workflow for automated code quality checks.

## Changes
- Replaced ESLint with Biome in frontend and relayer packages
- Created biome.json configuration at root
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated checks and auto-fixing
- Removed all ESLint dependencies and configs

## Post-Merge Steps
1. Run \`npm install\`
2. Run \`npm run check:write\` to apply initial formatting
3. Commit and push formatting changes
